This is a jenky way of mananging dependent libraries.  Currently, dependencies for this project live in the libs/ directory as submodules, and they use a variety of disjoint build systems, including gyp, cmake, and build tools.  If those build tools are capable of generating a Makefile, I have copied that makefile into a dependency-specific directory under libs/Makefiles/.  Additionally, there should be a script in each that can copy the makefile back into the submodule directory tree and run make.

These will need to be updated every time we pull in the latest for the dependency submodules.
